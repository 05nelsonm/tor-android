Orbot: Android Onion Routing Robot
***********************************************
This is a freely licensed open-source application developed for the 
Android platform, that acts as a front-end to the Tor binary application.
Orbot also provides an HTTP Proxy for connecting web browsers and other
HTTP client applications into the Tor SOCKS interface. 

*** PreReqs ***
You need the Android Developer SDK to compile and build the APK file: http://developer.android.com/
The project files including in this distribution are meant to be used with Eclipse: http://eclipse.org/

*** How to use ***
Currently, Orbot will work with any application that supports using an HTTP or SOCKS Proxy.
Once you start Tor using Orbot, you can then point your application to HTTP port 8118 or SOCKS port 9050
on localhost IP 127.0.0.1.

You can also set the Android system-wide HTTP proxy using the Mobile Network APN:
Settings->Mobile networks->Access Point Names->(select your Carrier APN):

Proxy: 127.0.0.1
Port:8118

** A Few Notes **

To ensure you are connected to the Tor network, you should browse to https://check.torproject.org

The first time you activate Orbot, it may take a while to connect to Tor. Check the message log to
ensure you are "100% Bootstrapped".
