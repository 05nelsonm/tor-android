<string name="help_text_1">Orbot requires different configuration depending on the Android operating system version it is used on.
Please visit https://www.torproject.org/docs/android.html for the latest information.</string>

<string name="help_text_2">For non-rooted Android 1.x devices: Please use the "ProxySurf" browser available in the Android Market, and set 
the HTTP Proxy to 127.0.0.1 and port 8118, for HTTP traffic only (HTTP/S will not work).</string>

<string name="help_text_3">For Instant Messaging, try "Beem" in the market, and set the SOCKS5 proxy to 127.0.0.1 / port 9050.</string>

<string name="help_text_4">For Android 2.x devices, you MUST ROOT your device in order for Orbot to work transparently, as there is no browser that will work for non-root devices. Otherwise, the "Beem" app will allow
you to set the SOCKS5 proxy to 127.0.0.1 and port 9050. You should also enable SSL to protect your username and password.</string>

<string name="help_text_5">If you root your device, whether it is 1.x or 2.x based, Orbot can transparently proxy any applicatons you select
and all DNS requests. This includes the built-in Browser, Gmail, YouTube and Maps, as well as any third-party app.</string>
